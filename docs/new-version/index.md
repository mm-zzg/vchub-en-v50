## License

A license is the direct embodiment of product pricing and sales strategy. It achieves precise monetization and market segmentation for different user groups by establishing various licensing models (such as annual subscription or perpetual license) and feature module combinations.

**In terms of pricing models**: It offers options like annual subscriptions and perpetual licenses to align with customers' budgetary preferences and long-term planning.

**In terms of product features**: By configuring different combinations of functional modules,such as I/O Tag limits, concurrent online users, and Add-On modules,it addresses the diverse needs of various production scenarios.

## Force logout online user

When the number of online users reaches the maximum allowed by the license, logging in with a user account that has security permissions will automatically force the earliest logged-in online user to log out, thereby freeing up a login slot.
