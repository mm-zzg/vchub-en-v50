# Product License

## Trial Version Instructions

After installation, VC Hub offers a 30-day free trial. During the trial period, all functions of the product can be used.

You can activate the product by purchasing a formal license. Currently, only online activation is supported.

## Product Authorization Explanation

VC Hub supports both **annual subscription** and **one-time purchase**. Users can only choose one of these methods for purchase.

Authorization can be granted based on the following several function modules:

#### I/O Tag

There are 6 different license quantities available. You can determine the number of licenses to purchase based on your specific situation.

- 1,000 I/O tags 
- 2,000 I/O tags
- 5,000 I/O tags
- 10,000 I/O tags
- 20,000 I/O tags
- 50,000 I/O tags

**Notes:**

1. The tag numbers cannot be added together. For example: If you need to use 3,000 I/O tags, based on the number of tags, you need to purchase a license with ≥ 3000 tags.So you need to purchase a license that supports 5,000 I/O tags. 
2. If the I/O tag license is not activated, the quality of the I/O tag will be displayed as "Bad_NotLicensed".
3. If the number of created I/O tags exceeds the maximum allowed by the I/O tag license, then according to the tag sorting rules, the tags beyond the maximum limit will have their quality set to "Bad_NotLicensed".
4. Tags with a quality status of "Bad_NotLicensed" will no longer be collected or pushed in the preview and runtime pages.


#### Concurrent Online User

 The concurrent user count including 3 different types of data. 

- 2 Concurrent Online Users
- 5 Concurrent Online Users
- 10 Concurrent Online Users

**When the online count reaches the maximum limit, the user logs in**
