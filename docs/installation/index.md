## Version

WAGO SCADA uses a version structure: `Major Version.Minor Version.Revision Version`. The project data version must match the version of the running program to operate.

---

## Uninstallation

The user data directory and the installation program directory are independent. Uninstalling will not delete user data. If necessary, you can manually delete the user data directory.

---

## Upgrade

- Within the maintenance period, you can upgrade to the WAGO SCADA installation package released during the maintenance period **for free**.
- If the maintenance has expired and has not been renewed, you can upgrade to the revision version for free. As long as the `Major Version.Minor Version` matches the current authorized version, there are no restrictions on upgrading.

> **Important:**
> Direct upgrade installation is not currently supported. Before upgrading, please **uninstall first**. After uninstalling, install the new version.
